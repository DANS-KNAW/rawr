      "Sociology is the study of human society, analyzing social behavior, relationships, culture, and social interaction. Spanning both social sciences and humanities, it employs empirical research and critical analysis to understand social order and change. Sociologists examine everything from individual interactions and social structures to broader societal issues, applying findings to social policy and exploring subjects like stratification, mobility, religion, law, gender, the digital divide, health, economy, and education.",

      'The proposed setting–Development Science Framework (DSF), views each SDG as a source of highly correlated Big Data attributes and seeks to explore their interactions in a predictive, spatio-temporal context. For example, the relationships among SDGs 13, 14 & 15 on human livelihood, reflected by SDGs 1 through 7, are particularly intriguing and modelling their dynamics can provide answers to general questions in the form of What Works Across Countries and Sectors? The relationships among attributes describe the invariant conditions that epitomise the meaningfulness of the concept which DSF learns from available data. DSF adopts first principles approach, treating SDGs as sub-projects, driven by the well-documented relationship between knowledge & development in time and space. It focuses on trust, interdisciplinarity, authoritative data, knowledge transfer, resources, tools & techniques. Analogous to Eleanor Roosevelt’s view on where universal rights begin, it takes a bottom-up approach to the universal agenda 2030, seeking real knowledge on indicators from \\"...small places, close to home–so close and so small that they cannot be seen on\\" the World Bank SDG Atlas. Its main objectives are therefore to map and deliver knowledge about clusters of individual societies on that global map, their disparate neighborhoods, activities, achievements and influencing factors, based on indicators deriving from relevant and authoritative data from various sources, including grey literature and citizen science. Its implementation strategy is for three pilot DSF SDG monitoring nodes to be established in three African countries with known socio-economic heterogeneity, in order to provide a clear baseline for the project. To effectively support agenda 2030 at the country level, the project requires a guarantee that policy makers affecting each monitoring node, are in full agreement with Open Data Initiative (ODI) agenda.',

Infrastructure and guidance are still required to make it easier for researchers to use this type of citation and to receive or give credit for the object used in the research. Solving the problem of these reliquary citations is critical to enabling reproducible research. Moreover, enabling these complex reliquary citations will be important for researchers to be able to trace citation and usage of their work and report on its impact to funders. For policy makers, it will allow the effects of policy decisions to be accurately tracked through citation and analysis of the supporting data.",

MSE researchers often need to answer complex questions such as “What structural properties and processing methods are required to develop new lightweight materials that significantly improve fuel efficiency yet meet safety standards satisfied by traditional materials in use today?” To this end we have seen the creation of programs such as the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) in the US that aim to decrease the cost and time to develop new materials by a factor of two through more effective discovery, access, and interoperability of experimental and simulation data. However, finding the latest materials data and resources to answer such questions amidst this rich diversity and accelerated growth is an increasingly difficult and time-consuming endeavor.",

    description:
      "The I-ADOPT WG will focus on creating a community-agreed framework for representing observable properties by bringing together groups that have been working on developing terminologies to accurately encode what was measured, observed, derived, or computed. The consensus building will be informed by reviewing current practices and by a set of use cases, which will be used to define the requirements and to test and refine the common framework iteratively. Much like a generic blueprint, this framework will be a basis upon which terminology developers can formulate local, but globally aligned, design patterns. With these, they may leverage their local “materials” in a multi-pronged attempt to represent complex properties observed across the environmental sciences (from marine to terrestrial ecosystems, as well as biodiversity, atmospheric, and Earth sciences). The WG will then seek to synthesize these approaches into global best practice recommendations. Furthermore, it will help mediate between generic observation standards (SSNO, SensorML, ..) and current community-led resources, fostering harmonized implementations. Through this effort, FAIRer observable property terminologies will be created, the global effectiveness of tools operating upon them will be improved and their impact increased. The WG will thus strengthen existing collaborations and build new connections between terminology developers and providers, disciplinary experts, and representatives of scientific data user groups.",

The continued proliferation and abundance of content driven metadata standards for scientific data present significant challenges for: 1) Individuals seeking guidance in the selection of appropriate metadata standards, and 2) Automatic processing capabilities for manipulating digital data. Research indicates the many researchers are following local metadata practices developed in a lab, or no standard at all (See Figure 1, Tenopir, et al, 2011). Additionally, research reveals that discipline-­‐specific metadata efforts have led to duplicative standards, given the lack of communication across communities (Willis, et al, 2012). A collaborative, open directory of metadata standards applicable to scientific data can help address these infrastructure challenges. MASDIR will succeed the work of the initially endorsed via the RDA Metadata Standards Directory Interest Group (MSDIG) and directly contribute to cyber-­‐infrastructure development by accomplishing short-­‐term goals listed directly below in Section 1.1.",

Farmers have gained this powerful capability because yield monitors on combines enable accurate measurement of yields. Networks of farmers have become increasingly common to exploit the potential of yield monitors to evaluate management practices at the field level. Networks of farmers have also become increasingly common because farmers understand the power of evaluating management practices across many fields. Collection of results from strip trials across many fields requires protocols for data stewardship, that is, for data reporting, sharing and archiving. All farmer networks have developed data stewardship protocols. The protocols, however, vary from network to network, and the protocols are not easily accessible to people outside the networks. Creation of a standardized set of protocols for data stewardship that are publicly available would promote the formation of new farmer networks. More importantly, the creation of standardized protocols, especially for confidentiality and sharing of data, would enable the combining of results from many networks into one secure database. A combined database would facilitate analyses across space and time that would provide much more useful and robust answers to many applied questions about crop production practices, which would increase profitability and decrease environmental pollution caused by food production.",

But this requires a PID to be uniquely associated with specific types of information, and those types and their association with PIDs must be well managed.

    description:
      "The increasing availability of research data and its evolving role as a first class scientific output in the scholarly communication requires a better understanding of and the possibility to assess data quality, which in turn can be described as conformance of data properties to data usability or fitness for use. These properties are multifaceted and cover various aspects related to data objects, access services, and data management processes such as the level of annotation, curation, peer review, and citability or machine readability of datasets. Moreover, the compliance of a data repository or data center providing datasets - for example with certification requirements - could serve as a useful proxy. Firstly, a concept of data fitness requires assessment of quality criteria to be included as well as the weighing of each of those criteria. The process should preferably lead to the development of a corresponding metric. Secondly, we want to find effective ways to expose and communicate this metric, for e.g. by using a labelling or tagging system whereby different usability levels are made explicit.",

Specifying the Wheat linked data framework will come with many questions: which (minimal) metadata to describe which type of data? Which vocabularies/ontologies/formats? Which good practices? Mainly based on the the needs of the Wheat initiatiative Information System (WheatIS) in terms of functionalities and data types, the working group will identify relevant use cases in order to produce a “cookbook” on how to produce “wheat data” that are easily shareable, reusable and interoperable.",

Through this work we will review the status of current guidance, what authors are providing, and the gap with desired outcomes. The desired outcome is a recommendation on guidelines for journals, authors, publishing staff, editors, peer-reviewers, standards, and machine readable infrastructure.",

This work will leverage and build upon existing resource records at FAIRsharing (an RDA WG and a curated, informative and educational resource on data and metadata standards, inter-related to databases and data policies) in evaluating existing community Omics standard records in contribution to an iterative and open Omics Domain Collection at FAIRsharing as part of the landscape review recommendation output. Leveraging FAIRsharing educational materials to help guide WG curation activities, the group will collect standalone Omics domain community standards and reporting guidelines for informed downstream crosswalk activities. The Omics landscape review and analysis collection serves to benefit and encourage continuous (machine-actionable) community level standard curation beyond the lifecycle of the WG for existing and future research community stakeholder groups focused on data standards in life sciences.",

But established research practices and infrastructures in the empirical humanities do not support this. The Empirical Humanities Metadata WG (EHM) will conduct research, develop a statement of best practices and release an adoptable product centered on what needs to be in place (standards, protocols, policies, cultural expectations) to make ethnographic and historical data archivable, discoverable and shareable.",
